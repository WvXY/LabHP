# **Biography**

To create a virtual world that can do things beyond reality is really cool. My dream is that oneday I can create an anime world with fully real-time rendering and interactive simulation, obeying the "Physical laws" that I set.

### Research Interests

-   Anime-style rendering, Physically-based simulation

### Hobbies

-   Anime, Classical music

### Master Thesis
Automatic Dynamic Texture Compression for Facial Blendshapes using Differentiable Framework
